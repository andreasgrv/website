             Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh.
              I was previously working as a research associate at <a href="http://persona.iit.demokritos.gr" target="_blank"> NCSR Demokritos</a>, a member of the Persona group. <br></p>

              <p>My interests are scattered all over the place, but if I had to choose a few labels to stick here - buzzwords included 
              , they would be Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. If these labels are not familiar, do not despair,
              I have created my own definitions for them!</p>
              <li> Machine Learning : A fancier and more pretentious name for pattern recognition in data carried out in order to extract information and rules and see
                how close to 100% we can get two numbers to be when using these rules on new data. </li>
              <li> Natural Language Processing : Playing with human input data that represents written text in some human language,
                and trying to understand why the computer is so bad at analyzing it compared to us. </li>

              <p><br>Behind the wishful naming and overstatements however, 
                these areas of Computer Science are extremely interesting and include many fascinating problems
              one can work upon.</p>
              <p>In my B.Sc. Thesis I worked on word and phrase similarity and tried to align sentences according to 
                word similarities based on word relationships like synonymy, antonymy etc. </p>
              <p> In the year following my graduation I worked on
                Author Profiling, Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction. Our team at NCSR Demokritos
                placed third in Pan 2015 on the
