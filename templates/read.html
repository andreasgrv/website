                            <h2>Benedictus</h2><br>
                            I once found a little owl playing amongst the thicket<br>
                            he curiously waved a little stick and then began to lick it<br>
                            of all your toes I do oppose you having only three<br>
                            To this request, the owl got dressed and flew up to the tree<br>
                            the thicket then in mighty woe began to stir and fidget<br>
                            for it had lost its only friend Benedictus the midget<br>
                            But hold on now, you don't suppose the owl was Benedictus<br>
                            it had toes three, flew up a tree if we held sticks it licked us<br>
                            His seemly rather eccentric ways evolved when he was younger<br>
                            hadn't he been the pope you see, he would have died of hunger<br>
                            Two were the source of his belief, three toes he now had sprouted<br>
                            and that's the reason, little bee, that he had always shouted<br>
                            I'm not a bee, I hold no stick, I claim to be the reader<br>
                            Your claim then is by far unjust, for books aren't merely made of dust<br>
                            They're made of withered sticks and sap, I bid farewell to you old chap<br>
                            And if by chance you were a bee, you are a true believer<br>

                            <h2>Intercheesy</h2><br>
                            My sweet, my cunning little fawn<br>
                            how know you I had cometh?<br>
                            I hed behind a patch of lawn<br>
                            I'll hide again, I prometh.<br>
                            Why are you rude, off courth you knew<br>
                            I have a lithp when weary<br>
                            as for my chetht it' th bwoad and bwue<br>
                            it'th althow bwown and haiwy<br>
                            Why utter such insane remarks<br>
                            If only fish were shaped like arcs<br>
                            then when you caught them on a stick<br>
                            they would erase the past<br>
                            for future generations lie<br>
                            all hidden in an apple pie<br>
                            with spoons of fish<br>
                            they dig the dish<br>
                            and dream of skiing fast<br>
                            This is the 18th line, do not read before this line if you are overaged.<br>
                            I was then suddenly run over by a rather obnoxious packet of crisps<br>
                            There was a huge crunch and my feelings were transferred to a parallel universe made entirely of cheese.<br>
                            In this five dimensional world enhabited by cheese wisps<br>
                            you couldn't move because of course there was no such thing as space, imagine if you please<br>
                            The first dimension was that of cash, and it was merely a number<br>
                            the second was of self esteem the third was that of slumber<br>
                            Visible to the cheesy eye, was only that of odour<br>
                            the fifth one was invisible to me as I was younger<br>
                            But reaching 27 now as aging here was done according to written lines of text<br>
                            and was not one of our so called dimensions<br>
                            <b>I</b><br>
                            <b>n</b><br>
                            <b>e</b><br>
                            <b>e</b><br>
                            <b>d</b><br>
                            <b>e</b><br>
                            <b>d</b><br>

                            42 to discover their 5th dimension.<br>
                            But I then discovered that linetravel here was a serious religious offense to their cheesy scriptwriter god.<br>
                            I was therefore charged with heresy and sentenced to life on Earth. <br>
                            So let me thleep my little fawn,<br>
                            I'm tired, chaffed, denied and torn<br>
                            but you're awake so you decide between what's right and wrong<br>
                            I'll hide again, and sleep for years<br>
                            until my ears are shaped like spears<br>
                            don't fall on them, and think before believing for too long.<br>
