title: Diversity, a curse or a blessing?

For the past days I've been mulling over my choices made in the last months. It is now clear to me that my soul is home to two very conflicting dispositions. On the one hand I'm a scrupulous control freak that wants to be sure that whatever I do is the best I can and exactly as it pleases me down to the last detail. On the other hand, I get bored when working on the same thing very easily, and find pleasure working on meaningless spontanious ideas in various domains -- I am addicted to having ideas and thinking about subjects and wondering about questions that interest me.

Under such circumstances, being a programmer in this day and age puts you in a very tight spot. You have absolutely no excuse to yourself as to why not to pursue your ideas. Everything is possible if you devote enough time and concentrate on a problem.

At the same time, being a programmer means that you are exposed to very many ideas which you unwillingly slam into while searching for solutions to problems that you have to solve using various tools that... Do the same thing!

I found the need to seperate knowledge in to three groups. Practical, Theoretical, and practical theoretical.

Theoretical: An idea to solve a problem
Practical : Details of a programming language
Practical theoretical: Write the algorithm - but no language.


Richard Feynman once stated that :
>
"...Psychologically we must keep all the theories in our heads, and every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different theoretical representations for exactly the same physics. He knows that they are all equivalent, and that nobody is ever going to be able to decide which one is right at that level, but he keeps them in his head, hoping that they will give him different ideas for guessing."

Now, from a theoretical point of view this is pretty obvious. By no way does one point of view obscure another.

From a practical point of view however, knowing six different representations is a mess. It is good to have worked with different languages, and had the important stuff sink in, but I find the details of each language too unimportant to remember. I keep getting muddled.


Recently I've been trying to overcome the complexity that arises when you are involved in many different projects over a short span of time. In such circumstances it is very common to have to work on different tasks, in different coding languages, on different operating systems, with different tools.

* Projects involve different tools: languages - frameworks - operating systems which all have a different way of expressing notions that semantically are the same.
* You are not proficient in thinking in tha above terms for the given language, framework etc. - you are learning along the way.
